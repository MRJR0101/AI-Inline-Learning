# Incoming Root Assets

This folder captures project-relevant assets that previously lived at repository root.

Included:

1. `ai-inline-learning-playbook.md` - expanded playbook narrative.
2. `index.html` - public-facing landing page variant.
3. `project_audit_loop.jsx` - audit loop UI/workflow prototype.

Purpose:

- Preserve provenance of moved files.
- Keep repository root focused on shared operations files.
- Provide a staging area before final placement into long-term docs structure.
